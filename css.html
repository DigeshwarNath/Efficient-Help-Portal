<b Mother is the pillar of strength in everyone’s life. She is the one without whom our life is incomplete. A mother nurtures her child, instil good manners in him and guide him in the journey called life. Students are told to write essays on mother so this essay will be of great help to them.

Mother is not simply a word but it is a whole universe in itself. She is the most important person in everybody’s life. A mother has the ability to love selflessly. The sacrifices made by a mother cannot be simply written in words. Mother’s love is selfless. Mom is the first word uttered by a child. Even if her child reaches the age of fifty then also he will be a child in the eyes of a mother. God cannot be everywhere so he made mothers. Everybody’s life is incomplete without a loving mother.
